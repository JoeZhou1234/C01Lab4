backend/server.js:
- Endpoint /deleteNote/:noteId was not fully implemented. 
- It does not do anything but simply returns status 500.

frontend/app.js:
- Formerly used optimistic UI rendering, deleting the note in the web view prior to sending a delete request.
- This is a problem because the user thinks the note was successfully deleted, regardless of whether the request to deleting the note was successful on the server side.
